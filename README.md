Question
a. Write a Python function which accepts a single list as a parameter. This list consists of any number of lists (1..n),
and you can assume each list only contains character strings (e..g. [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘bc’…]). The function should print out the
following:
- Strings that appear in more than one list
- The total number of unique strings across all lists
- The total number of strings that were processed
b. Write a test which verifies the example case below:
Example Case
Input:
[‘g’, ‘gh’, ‘ghj’, ‘g’], [‘j’, ‘ju’, ‘gh’, ‘gk’, ‘gn’]
Output:
Strings appearing in multiple lists: ‘gh’
Number of unique strings: 7
Total number of strings processed: 9
